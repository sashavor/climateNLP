We maximize our positive impact and minimize our negative impact on society and the environment throughout our value chain by acting ethically and transparently .
In doing so, we seek to comply not only with the regulations in force but also with the main international standards .
The Sustainability Plans are articulated around the six axes of   Sustainability Model  Our vision of sustainability  and preparation of this Plan  Under these premises, our  Sustainability Model  incorporates ethical, environmental, and  social considerations into our decision - making process, based on dialogue with  stakeholders.
We do this every year, creating initiatives that address the concerns of  these stakeholders.
This is how the Sustainability Plans   action plans that are available to the public and  created on an annual basis   are born.
The  Global Sustainability Plan  is the roadmap  forming the basis for deployment of  Local Plans .
The plans also contain commitments in  relation to the local context.
3 At Repsol we support the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and use the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a reference when defining our priorities .
We make a significant contribution to all 17 SDGs as we act responsibly in highly different environments, and we believe that it is necessary to identify those that are more clearly linked to our sector, activity, our impacts on people, the economy and the environment, and the expectations of our stakeholders .
Sustainable  Development Goals We have drawn up this prioritization in due consideration of the SDGs considered most relevant to the company and our stakeholders, concluding that our efforts must primarily focus on SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy), on SDG 8 (Decent work and economic growth) and on SDG 13 (Climate action), in view of our role in access to energy, contribution to social and economic development, and the fight against climate change .
And, secondly, on SDG 6 (Clean water and sanitation), due to our commitment to the optimization of water management ; on SDG 9 (Industry innovation and infrastructure), in view of our support of innovation and technology ; and on SDG 12 (Responsible production and consumption), due to our focus on the Circular Economy .
For Repsol, the most efficient manner of contributing to the 2030 Agenda is by collaborating with other public and private institutions to exchange knowledge and technologies .
Thus we feel it is essential to join forces in connection with SDG 17 (Partnerships for the goals) .
Consequently and as part of our commitment to the 2030 Agenda, we have prioritized the SDGs by analyzing which are most important for the Company and our stakeholders, allowing us to focus our actions on the areas where we can make the most significant contribution 4 The 2019 Global Sustainability Plan establishes 31 objectives in the medium term, structured around our Sustainability Model areas, aimed at our businesses, our supply chain, our employees and society .
We have ambitions for each of the issues and we establish annual lines of action, which year after year will contribute to achieving the objectives .
You can see the detail of each  objective by clicking on each area.

Guarantee equal opportunities as a distinctive element of an integrated,  diverse and inclusive company.
People Diversity, work - life balance, climate and retaining talent At Repsol we know that the pillars for achieving the objectives we set out in our strategy are based on 4 lines of action : Technology, an ambitious Digitalization Program, employee talent and an even more efficient Corporation .
Future competitiveness is guaranteed with a new organization, new ways of working that are less structured and bureaucratic, more agile and flexible, with new capabilities that allow us to advance in the energy transition .
Our more than 25 , 000 employees worldwide make up a diverse, expert and committed team that is our greatest competitive advantage as a Company .
At Repsol we understand diversity as a distinguishing element that allows us to be more competitive by having people of different origins, age, gender, abilities, etc .
We are committed to the integration of people with disabilities, promoting a committed and caring social model .
We promote the evolution of new forms of working to ensure an increasingly flexible working environment , to promote collaborative work and to adapt to the new requirements and lifestyles of the societies in which we operate .
We value, promote and facilitate the balance between the professional and personal lives of our employees and our work - life balance measures have made us a point of reference in our sector and one of the best companies to work for in Spain .
In addition, we have revised our minimum global work - life balance which exceed local legislation in many of the countries in which we are present, in order to adapt them to all of our locations, ensuring standard levels of protection for our employees in cases of maternity and paternity leave, breastfeeding, marriage or domestic partnership or the death of a family member .

RETURN People Diversity, work - life balance, climate and retaining talent Contribution to SDGs Safe operation We pursue a target of Zero Accidents with a high level of safety in our processes and facilities, paying particular attention to the protection of people and the surrounding environment, and to the awareness of our suppliers and contractors .
In 2018 , in the conviction that Safety and the Environment form the basis of value creation, excellence and responsibility, we launched our 2025 Safety and Environment Strategy 15 We have established the key lines of action on which the Company will focus its safety efforts up to 2025 : we intend to drive culture, transformational leadership and awareness in connection with safety and the environment .
Here one of the key features is safety in our processes, where we intend to lead the industry through management of our risks, the integrity of our facilities, and better preparation for crises and emergencies .
By way of a demonstration of our commitment, safety targets may have an impact on the variable remuneration of our employees of more than 15 % .
RETURN AMBITION:  Zero  accidents Safe operation One of the essential pillars that sustain our strength as a Company is to operate in an excellent and safe manner .
We are aware of the consequences that any accident can have, both on people and the environment, so we consider the safety of our processes key, where we have set out to be industry leaders through risk management for the life cycle of the assets, from design and construction to decommissioning and permanent abandonment of facilities .
In order to guarantee the integrity of our facilities, we apply the most demanding international standards, and we ensure the correct selection and permanent availability of the required protection barriers .
All preventive efforts are complemented by adequate preparation and an optimum capacity to respond to possible emergencies, with the aim of limiting the impact on people and the environment in the event of any incident .
We are still committed to strengthening the culture of safety as an indispensable influence for the prevention of major accidents .
Only through the commitment of all the people who make up the organisation is it possible for safety to become a fundamental value present in all decisions and daily actions .
We believe that it is necessary to enhance the consideration of human factors in all key processes, improving risk awareness, increasing levels of transparency and building a working environment that reduces the probability of errors and minimises their consequences .
16 An area of vital importance for the strengthening of a robust safety culture is the exercise of effective and visible leadership .
With this objective, we will develop a specific programme , with a high impact and global reach, accompanied by awareness actions regarding Process Safety, risk management and integrity of the facilities at all management levels .
To reduce the exposure of people to the most common risks in their jobs, we explore the possibilities that technology and digital media offer us, contributing to a more technological safety management .
Given the  expansion and internationalisation situation, which will take us to new operating environments, it is especially important to have a robust framework for action, which allows us to be recognised as an excellent Company wherever we operate, either directly or through our partners .
RETURN Safe operation Safety of our employees, contractors, parties and the local community 2023 Objectives :  Implement consistent safety criteria in supplier management and in all processes entailing the procurement of goods and services with high safety and environmental risk .
Train and raise awareness about safety among all parties involved in purchasing and procurement processes .
2025 Objectives :  Implement processes that ensure risk management throughout the life cycle of assets and projects in all businesses of the Company to achieve maximum integrity of facilities, correct operations of safety barriers, optimum preparation to resolve crises and emergencies, and operations entailing asset dismantling .

RETURN Contribution to SDGs Environment We share the concerns of society in relation to the need to look after the environment in which we live .
We seek minimum impact of our operations, minimizing atmospheric emissions, optimizing water management, waste management, reduction of discharge pollutants, improvements to prevention systems and response to spills, considering biodiversity as a key component .
Our 2025 Safety and Environment Strategy , launched in 2018 , establishes the key lines of action on which the Company will focus its environmental efforts up to 2025 : we must be able to quantify and assess environmental impacts and dependences in order to back business decisions, placing the emphasis on more sensitive aspects wherever we operate, particularly water ; our goal will also be to maintain a social license by means of excellent sustainable environmental management throughout the entire life cycle of our projects and operations 18 All this enhances the generation of new opportunities within the Circular Economy, making efficient  use of natural resources, with criteria of maximum efficiency, maximum transparency and lesser  environmental impact.
RETURN AMBITION:  Excellence in environmental  management and integration in decision - making Environment The Circular Economy is a substantial part of Repsol's Global Sustainability Plan .
It plays a very important role in our Sustainability Model in order to achieve a greater contribution to society with criteria of efficiency and transparency, producing the least possible impact .
With the Circular Economy, we look for :  Increasing value, prolonging the life of resources, products and materials, thus generating benefits  Reducing the demand for raw materials , water and energy by recirculating them  Maximum reduction of waste generation by closing the life cycle of available resources We know that water is an essential element that plays a key role in economic growth and is predicted to be one of the most relevant environmental challenges to the sustainability of companies in the coming years .
For Repsol it is a strategic resource : We use it both in industrial centers and in Exploration and Production activities, and so ensuring its supply in both quality and quantity is essential to continue with the operation of all the Company's facilities .
For this reason, we work on its integral management, in order to minimize the risks and impacts associated with water, and to implement actions and initiatives in the Company's facilities .
19 Since 2017 we have been members of the Natural Capital Coalition, a collaborative entity made up of organizations from different fields : academic, business, research, finance, etc .
, whose objectives are to harmonize the approach to the concept of natural capital by proposing solutions that can be quickly implemented on a large scale and to promote a change of behavior in society that encourages the consideration of this concept .
To this end, we consider it necessary to incorporate the real value of environmental impacts and dependencies into the economic analysis of projects and operations to improve decision - making related to new projects, acquisitions and the search for operational excellence for our assets .
The organization's effort to improve its environmental management will be neglected if environmental culture and awareness are not as solid as they should be and are not sufficiently rooted in operations .
We focus our efforts on improving training for the Company's employees and equally for all those involved in the purchasing and hiring processes .
Given the Company's expansion and internationalization, which will take us to new operating environments, it is particularly important to have a robust framework for action in terms of safety and the environment, which will enable us to get to know the environmental criteria of our partners and the levels of risk they manage .
RETURN Environment 2023 Objectives :  Implement consistent environmental criteria in supplier management and in all processes entailing the procurement of goods and services with high safety and environmental risk .
Train and raise awareness about the environment among all parties involved in purchasing and procurement processes .

Our challenge is to supply energy in a safe, efficient, accessible and sustainable manner, reducing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions .
There are many possible pathways to a low emission future for which we have identified three common elements : improving energy efficiency and energy savings ; reducing emissions in electricity generation, where natural gas will be a key player ; and deploying low - emission technologies in end - use sectors .
21 Our commitment is evident with the objective of reducing 2 .
1 Mt of 2 eq emissions at the end of the 2014 - 2020 period, an objective that the Company has just extended to a new 2018 - 2025 Plan for the reduction of 3 Mt of CO 2 eq emissions .
At the same time, we have defined reduction targets to 2025 for methane emissions and for torch gas burning .
We have joined the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) to share best practices and technology solutions, and participate in the OGCI Climate Investment Fund, to channel the committed investment of $ 1 billion over ten years in the development of technologies to reduce GHG emissions on a significant scale .
RETURN AMBITION:  By 2040, reduce our carbon intensity by as  much as 40% from 2016, in line with what is required  by society and the Paris Agreement (2 ° C scenario).
Climate Change In the transition to a low emission future, an end - to - end approach is needed that involves thinking about the costs and maturity of the technologies involved in the process .
Repsol's strategy is part of five - year plans reviewed annually and, in order to define them, the risks and opportunities of climate change and its impact on strategic lines and competitiveness are taken into account .
Thus, with the recent update of the 2016 - 2020 Strategic Plan, Repsol is anticipating major trends, such as the increase in electricity demand and the key role of natural gas in the energy transition (Repsol has an upstream gas portfolio of around 63 % of production and 70 % of reserves) .
Our short to medium - term strategy is influenced by competitiveness issues (energy costs and CO 2 ), as well as by the regulatory framework affecting our activities .
Following the Paris Agreement, the commitments made by countries will have an important impact on climate policies .
In the medium to long term, there are legislative developments both at a global level (energy and climate roadmap from the EU to 2050 , Sustainable finance) and at a local level (draft law on Climate Change and Energy Transition in Spain) that will be transposed into future legislative packages over the coming years .
22 Repsol has defined a long - term carbon intensity indicator in t CO 2 /GJ, which measures the Company's commitment to supplying the energy (GJ) demanded by society with the lowest possible emissions (t CO 2 ) .
Repsol has the ambition to reduce its carbon intensity (t CO 2 /GJ), in line with the International Energy Agency's Sustainable Development (SD) scenario, IEA (reduction from 40 % to 2040 ), without forgetting that at the same time it must provide the energy that society needs for its development and well - being .
The different metrics and associated objectives defined by the Company to further its commitment to mitigating climate change are set out below .
RETURN Climate Change 2020 Objectives :  By 2020 , reduce the Company's carbon intensity indicator by 3 % (tons of CO 2 / GJ of energy supplied) .
As part of the 2014 - 2020 Energy and Carbon Plan, achieve a reduction of 2 .
1 million tons of CO 2 eq in the Refining Spain, Refining Peru, Chemical and Exploration and Production (operated) businesses .
2025 Objectives :  As part of the new Energy and Carbon Plan 2018 - 2025 , achieve a reduction of 3 million tons of CO 2 eq in Refining operations in Spain, Refining operations in Peru, Chemicals and Exploration and Production (operated) .
Reduce routine flaring by 50 % in the Exploration and Production (operated) business by 2025 from 2018 (the first year of segregated information)  Reduce methane emissions by 25 % by 2025 from 2017 in the Exploration and Production (operated) business and contribute to the OGCI* collective goal .
23 For the year 2019 we are committed to :  Establish a reliable and consistent calculation methodology in all assets to segregate routine and non - routine flaring and identify actions for reduction in each .

We believe in technological innovation as a way to build more efficient and environmentally sustainable energy systems .
At Repsol, we are committed to building a network of partnerships with universities and research centers .
This promotes the implementation of ambitious ideas that enable us to confront the challenges we are facing and build a sustainable future, in line with our commitment to the environment .
Technology is evolving at vertiginous speed, and we must be able to incorporate technological advances at the moment they occur .
Therefore, we have an ambitious digitalization program that will transform the company, promote cultural change and allow us to develop digital solutions to satisfy new forms of energy consumption .
Similarly, we forge alliances and contribute to the growth of companies in emerging areas related to reliability in operations, circular economy, advanced mobility, energy diversification, new materials and digital technologies applied to exploration and production 24 RETURN AMBITION:  Drive technological innovation as a  lever of transformation towards more  sustainable business models Innovation and  technology The world is in a process of change and transformation in which the development and incorporation of new technologies, their transfer and implementation are the guarantee so that we can currently offer quality products and services and anticipate these changes .
Specifically, and in a context of transition to a low - carbon economy after the commitments made on climate change after the Paris Agreement, technology becomes a key pillar for the achievement of our goals .
To achieve our goals we want to focus on addressing the current challenges of energy companies such as reducing energy intensity and CO 2 emissions , improving the profitability of current assets, through sustainable and competitive production, differentiation of products from the competition, differentiated solutions based on Data and providing customer - oriented energy services .
Our main objective is to accelerate the incorporation of technologies and new innovative business models into Repsol's businesses and practices .
